# embeddingplyr: Tools for Working With Text Embeddings

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

## About

Common operations with word and text embeddings within a
‘tidyverse’/‘quanteda’ workflow, as demonstrated in [Data Science for
Psychology: Natural Language](http://ds4psych.com). Includes simple
functions for calculating common similarity metrics, as well as higher
level functions for loading pretrained word embedding models
(e.g. ‘GloVe’), applying them to words, aggregating to produce text
embeddings, and reducing dimensionality.

## Installation

You can install the development version of embeddingplyr from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# devtools package required to install quanteda from Github 
remotes::install_github("rimonim/embeddingplyr") 
```

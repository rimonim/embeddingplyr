#' 100-d GloVe Model Pretrained on Twitter (subset)
#'
#' An embeddings object containing a subset of glove.twitter.100d pretrained by
#' Pennington et al. (2014) on 2B Tweets. The subset includes only embeddings for
#' common English words, as defined by [Peter Norvig's compilation of the 1/3
#' million most frequent English words](https://norvig.com/ngrams/count_1w.txt),
#' derived from the Google Web Trillion Word Corpus.
